##TurboSphere##

TurboSphere is a reimplementation and modernization of the [Sphere RPG Engine](spheredev.org/). It is a simple, fast, and powerful game engine. It is a clean reimplementation of Sphere, no source code and very little code structure is inherited from Sphere.

TurboSphere uses plugins for all its functionality.

TurboSphere uses [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org/) and [Google's V8](http://code.google.com/p/v8/). This combination allows for simple or complex games to be created easily using JavaScript.

TurboSphere also uses the T5 kay/value file reading library, and can optionally use AMD's libm instead of the system libm.

Want to ask a question? TurboSphere is supported on the [Sphere forums](http://forums.spheredev.org/). Be sure to mention you are using TurboSphere, as the original Sphere is also supported there.
