Android builds of TurboSphere are in no way supported. This file is a list of what I had to go through (and I'm not done going through it!) to get TS running on Android.

Before you begin: Use Linux for this. 
No really, use Linux for this. 

You're building ELF files for a Unix machine that has the Linux Kernel, using GCC. Use Linux.


Don't use Windows. 



It will be a huge hassle to not use Linux.



1. You need V8. Get it: svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.19 v8

2. Get the Android NDK. Which is a huge download.

3. Do this at the V8 root: make dependencies

4. Do this, too: make android_arm.release library=shared snapshot=off

5. It will probably complain about the NDK not being found. Export the variable it wants as the root of the NDK.

6. On x64 Linux, you CAN use the 64-bit NDK. You will just need to change the Android.makefile in V8. It's VERY SIMPLE! (I know, something in V8 after Scons went away being easy to hack!?)
	Change:
		    TOOLCHAIN_DIR = linux-x86
		  to
		    TOOLCHAIN_DIR = linux-x86_64
		    
	Why doesn't V8 do this to begin with? I don't know.
