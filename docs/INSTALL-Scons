TurboSphere can be built and installed on both Linux and experimentally on Windows using the Scons build system.

The basic command for building TurboSphere using scons is just 'scons'. This fully builds TurboSphere, and TurboSphere is now fully usable on Windows.

On Linux, the core libraries and V8 must be installed as well. The command to do this is
  'scons --install_libs=y --build_plugins=all buildplugins libinstall confwrite'

You omit build_plugins and buildplugins to not build the plugins for TurboSphere.

If you have built any version of TurboSphere before using Scons, you can omit the confwrite option. Finally, run 'ldconfig' as root and you will be able to use TurboSphere.
